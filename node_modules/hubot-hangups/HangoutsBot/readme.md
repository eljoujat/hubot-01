HangoutsBot
==============

This is a fork of the work done by [wardellchandler](https://github.com/wardellchandler) on his [HangoutsBot](https://github.com/wardellchandler/HangoutsBot). 

For our purposes it doesn't need to do anything other than just proxy commands so we have pruned out some of what we don't need, and will be trimming it down to the minimum.
