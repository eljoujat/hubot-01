This adapter allows integrating your Hubot with Skype.

Available functionality:
* Sending / Receiving messages in personal chats with contacts
* Sending / Receiving messages in group chats with anyone in the group (non-contacts included)

What's missing:
* Sending / Accepting / Rejecting contact requests
* Sending / Receiving of files
* Recognizing contact presense (appearing online ; going offline..etc)

Also note that this adapter can not connect to the old P2P group chats. That's a general limitation of Skype's web offerings as the old P2P groups don't go through Skype's servers.

3. Export necessary environment variables.
4. Add `hubot-skype-web` as dependency in your package.json: `npm install hubot-skype-web --save`
5. Start your hubot with the Skype Web adapter: `hubot --adapter skype-web`

Troubleshooting
---------------

Please fill in issues to this Github project istead of emailing me directly. Keeping the communication here saves me from answering multiple emails for the same things.

You may have troubles running this under Linux with PhantomJS 1.9. You should try using 2.0. At the time of writting this there is still no official build. You can find my build [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/phantomjs/dimkov/phantomjs/CAasXq1Yzz0/fyjIm58cXk8J).
